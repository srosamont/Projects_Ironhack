5) **New-York taxi rides**: this a two-parts project.
	- ride duration prediction: the target was to predict the ride duration. First I used unsupervised learning to cluster the data. I wanted to do feature reduction, keeping the information available in features I wanted to remove. Then I used supervised learning algorithms to predict the ride duration. 
	- fare prediction :the target was to predict the fare for the rides based on a dataset of 55 Millions records.
* 8 days to complet this project.*
